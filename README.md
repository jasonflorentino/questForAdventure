# üè∞ Quest For Adventure

*A text based adventure built with python*

### This is a personal project and very much a work in progress. Thanks!

2020-12-05: Still under construction but it feels like the design is settling in better. The different pieces of the game have been more clearly separated in to objects and functions in their own modules. It's already feeling easier to debug, refactor, and maintain. Now that the design and flow of the program is taking shape, the next step will be bringing in more of what the player can do in the game.

2020-11-23: Under Construction! In the midst of the third iteration now that I have an even better understanding of Classes and Objects.

2020-10-11: Still just setting everything up and figuring things out. Got some big ambitions (from my standpoint) for what this game will be able to do. This is definitely going to be an adventure all its own.
